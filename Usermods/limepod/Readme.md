## limepod's mods

This is an overhaul of many parts, and none are made to be compatible with the original files.

* The XY Joints are modified to re-use the CNC top half from siboor
* The front idlers are remade to include tensioning, and moved forward to leave more space for the Y axis
* The A/B motor mounts are remade to be much bulkier, and the dock bar is now supported by aluminum brackets
* The carriage is modified to print in multiple parts, and various other changes to ease maintenance
* The toolheads have a number of changes, including the acorn nuts being shifted slightly, which makes them incompatible with the stock carriage
